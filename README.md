# PwC-Diversity-Inclusion-Project
## Here is the background information on the task
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.
At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Here, we create a dashboard on the employee participation in the organisation. We define the key KPIs like, New Hires, Promotions, Employee Exits and Employee Gender ratio to understand the situation of diversity and inclusivity in the workforce. Enabling diversity and eliminating gender-based stereotyping is key to the balanced workforce and company success.

## Insights
(1) The higher turnover percentage among female employees suggests that there may be factors leading to dissatisfaction or challenges specific to female employees’ experiences within the company. This could include issues related to work-life balance, workplace culture, or career advancement opportunities.

(2) The observation that there are more male employees in higher-level job profiles indicates that there may be systemic barriers or a lack of support for female employees to progress into leadership positions.

(3) Higher promotions of females in the Junior Officer profile but at the top level profile female promotion is lower. This may be connected to performance rating, lack of support, and training to improve performance.

(4) Maximum hiring of employees  is done from Switzerland ,France & Germany respectively, hence in order to increase diversity need to hire talented employees from different part of globe.

(5) FTE's are more likely to leave  as well as male as highly leaver than females.

## Task performed & Analysis
(1) Led the development of a comprehensive PWC Power BI dashboard on Diversity & Inclusion, employing advanced data cleaning and validation techniques to ensure KPI accuracy.

(2) Created interactive visualizations like line and clustered column charts to convey insights on gender-based promotion rates and stacked bar charts to showcase gender diversity in hiring across roles.

(3) Applied strong analytical skills to calculate essential metrics such as promotion percentages, gender ratios in hiring, turnover rates, and average performance ratings for men and women, offering actionable insights for diversity initiatives.

(4) Utilized data-driven decision-making to draw strategic conclusions, emphasizing the importance of fostering a balanced workforce and eliminating gender-based stereotypes to position the firm as a leader in diversity and inclusion practices.

## Conclusion
More women should be hired and most especially promoted because the gap in the ratio of men to women is quite large. 
For Executive and Director position,female employee count as well as the promotion  count is too low compared to male employee, hence more women should be hired as well as promoted.
Age group 30-39 has more rate of promotion compared to 40-49 age group, experience should be consider as one of the the one of the criteria for promotion checklist.
